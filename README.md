# project-1
Planning:

I wanted to create a game that could be a fun thinking game. I didn't want to do something as simple as hangman, I wanted something a little more complex so I thought Wheel of Fortune would be fun. I initially did a wireframe of what I wanted it to look like. The header includes three divs: player-bank, the title, and lives. Next I created the grid-container, which contains 52 divs for the wheel of fortune board that displays the letters as you guess them. My next step was to get an image for the actual wheel, at this point I didn't know if I wanted to have the wheel spin or just return a random number. I created a wheel button that you press to get a wheel-value from the wheel, a message-box to display the wheel-value from the wheel, and a next button to go to the next question. I created my last section which contained my clue button, with a div that would display a clue to help you. A submit input so you could type your guess, and a submit button to submit your answer.

Bugs: 
-Getting the wheel image to stop bouncing.(Fixed: the wheel image and the div we're not the same size.)
-Correct amount of degrees of the wheel to turn.
